Purpose of this fork
====================

If you visit the [google code page](http://code.google.com/p/jira-suite-utilities/) for this project, you'll notice that
the maintainer of this plugin has some strong words to say about Atlassian.  In addition to that the maintainer has
taken down the source code from the google code page and from GitHub.

Atlassian are currently in the process of talking to the maintainer to resolve the issues that have arisen.  In the
meantime, we have created this fork from other forks we found on GitHub of the project, so as to ensure that no matter
what happens, the project can live on.  We don't intend that this be the new home of JIRA Suite Utilities, but until the
conflict has been resolved, we will keep this fork here.
